                How can I use OpenHatch to automatically
                document my <abbr title='Free, Libre Open Source
                    Software'>FLOSS</abbr> contributions?

                <h4>Automagically import your contributions
                    from other networks</h4>

                <div>
                    <p>Your OpenHatch profile is where you can write about your
                    involvement in free/open source projects. People contribute in
                    lots of ways: code, documentation, translations, bug reports,
                    packaging, and more.</p>

                    <p>The profile editor contains an importer to pull in what
                    we can find via other websites. When you search for
                    yourself, we examine project hosting sites and source code
                    repositories.

                    The profile we put together combines the
                    trails you've left behind on other websites.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Add what we missed</h4>

                <div>
                    <p>The OpenHatch importer can't find the patches you submitted
                    to a mailing list, the work you did organizing a documentation
                    sprint, and other kinds of non-committer contributions. In the
                    profile editor, you can add projects and URLs that the importer
                    didn't discovered automatically.</p>

                    <p>Your OpenHatch profile serves as a reminder to yourself of all
                    the cool things you've done. It's also smart to maintain a
                    portfolio of your free software work so you can put it on your
                    resume.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Grab your widget</h4>

                <div>
                    <p>When your profile is ready, you can embed your OpenHatch
                    profile on your own web things. You'll find a widget waiting in
                    your personal settings.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>There is no canonical project description</h4>

                <div>
                    <p>When you add a project to your profile, you appear on that
                    project's page on OpenHatch. On that page, we take a random
                    contributor's description of the project to give a voice to all
                    the people involved.</p>
