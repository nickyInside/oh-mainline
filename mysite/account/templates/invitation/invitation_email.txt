{% load base_extras %}Hi there. I am a robot. A human named {% with invitation_key|invitation_key2user as u %}{% with u.get_full_name as n %}{{ n }}{% if n %} ({% endif %}{{ u.username }}{% if n %}){% endif %}{% endwith %}{% endwith %} asked me to let you know about a website called OpenHatch. OpenHatch makes it easier to find interesting things to do in free/libre/open source software (aka FLOSS).

Here 'tis: https://openhatch.org/

Things you can do once you get there:
* Find a cool bug (or other sort of volunteering opportunity): https://openhatch.org/search/
* Learn what other people in FLOSS are working on: https://openhatch.org/people/
* Chat about how to contribute to libre software: https://openhatch.org/projects/

Kind regards,

A Robot
