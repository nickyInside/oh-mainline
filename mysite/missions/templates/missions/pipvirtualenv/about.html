    <h3>Using pip and virtualenv</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <h3>About pip</h3>
    <p>Python code that is not a part of the
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/">Python Standard Library</a>
    is commonly released in the form of packages. As these packages are
    not a part of the standard library, we use tools like pip to download
    and install these 'third-party' packages. Using pip, we can install
    code other developers have written and use it in our own projects.</p>

    <p><a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html">pip</a> is
    a package management system used to install and manage third-party
    software packages written in Python. pip stands for "python install python".
    Many packages can be found in the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">
    Python Package Index (PyPI)</a>.</p>

    <h3>About virtualenv/virtualenvwrapper</h3>
    <p><a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/">
    The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python!</a> gives a good explanation
    of what a Virtual Environment actually is, in 
    <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/">
    its section about virtual environments</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>A Virtual Environment, put simply, is an isolated working
    copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without
    worry of affecting other projects.</blockquote>

    <blockquote> For example, you can work on a project which requires
    Django 1.3 while also maintaining a project which requires Django 1.0.
    </blockquote>

    <p><a href="http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>
    is a tool that allows you to create isolated Python environments.
    <a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">
    virtualenvwrapper</a> is simply a wrapper around virtualenv and it
    provides a set of intuitive commands that make it easier to work with
    virtual environments. It also does the job of putting all of your
    virtual environments in one place.</p>

    <p>To summarize, virtual environments are responsible for preventing
    different versions of the same software from interfering with each other,
    thus, leaving you free to work on more than one project at a time without 
    worrying about any kind of conflicts.</p>

    <h3>What you'll learn</h3>
    <p>After completing this mission, you will be able to install, 
    manage and remove third-party Python packages using pip and create
    and work with isolated Python environments using virtualenv and     
    virtualenvwrapper.</p>

    <h3>Getting started</h3>
    <p>This mission consists of five parts: setting up pip and
    virtualenv, creating virtual environments and installing packages,
    removing packages and deactivating virtual environments, learning
    more about pip and virtualenv, and a quick reference at the end.</p>
