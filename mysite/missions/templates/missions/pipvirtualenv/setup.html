    <h3>Setup pip and virtualenv</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="body">

    <h3>Linux</h3>

    <p>To install pip, virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper and wheel execute the
    following commands at the terminal for your Linux distro:</p>

    <p>On Debian or Ubuntu (this includes Debian/Ubuntu derivative distros
    like Linux Mint, Xubuntu, Kubuntu, etc.):</p>
    <kbd>sudo apt-get install python-pip python-virtualenv virtualenvwrapper python-wheel</kbd>

    <p>On Fedora (or Fedora derivative distros):</p>
    <kbd>sudo yum install python-pip python-virtualenv python-virtualenvwrapper python-wheel</kbd>

    <p>Some Python packages that have C extensions also require a C compiler
    so that the C extensions can be compiled. A good example of a package
    that has such requirements is <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a>,
    a package for scientific computing with Python.</p>

    <p>To install a C compiler on Debian or Ubuntu, at the terminal,
    type the following command and press Enter:</p>
    <pre>sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev</pre>

    <p>To install a C compiler on Fedora, at the terminal, type the
    following command and press Enter:</p>
    <pre>sudo yum install python-devel</pre>

    <h3>Mac OS X</h3>
    <p>Before you can work with pip and virtualenvs, you'll need to check if
    Python is installed on your machine; checking for Python on your computer
    is as simple as opening up the Terminal application and typing <q>python</q>
    and pressing Enter. If you're greeted with a Python prompt (which looks like
    <q>>>></q>), you're good to go; instead if you get an error, we recommend going
    through the <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/">
    Installing Python on Mac OS X</a> section of the <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/">
    The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python!</a></p>
