Adding a User
=============

the OpenHatch community welcomes its users to actively participate in various 
activities such as contributing to a project, finding a bug and adding your own project.

- Choose the account that you want to sign up with 
  or click "Sign up without OpenID" on the right hand side.
- Once the verification process is complete you will be redirected to the registration page.
