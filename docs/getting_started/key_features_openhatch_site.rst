=============================
Key Features of openhatch.org
=============================

This document lists features that the openhatch.org site is supposed
to have. These are the guiding priorities for the maintenance and
development community.

The "List of features" section below is supposed to state high-level
goals that site visitors should expect to achieve when using the
website.

To the extent that our work together on the OpenHatch codebase
provides value to the world, I think it makes sense to think about
what users can expect from OpenHatch.


List of features
================

OpenHatch Friends and Fans
--------------------------

As a general fan of OpenHatch, I want to learn more about OpenHatch's activities and the organization (including how to get in touch, and how to get involved) by visiting the front page of the website.


Site visitors
-------------

As a site visitor, I want to be reassured that people actually use the site.

.. note::We achieve this via the recent site activity feed.


Open Source Contributor
-----------------------

As a prospective open source contributor, I want to visit the
OpenHatch site and be able to find ways to get involved in open
source.

.. note:: Implementation detail: Right now we focus on helping
   people find "bitesize" bugs in open source projects.

   We've gotten feedback that "bitesize bugs" are OK, but that we could do a better job of contextualizing the bugs as being within a particular project, and that many visitors are motivated by the open source project they'd contribute to first, and the task they'd do second.


As a prospective open source contributor, I want to visit the OpenHatch website and learn skills related to getting involved in open source.

.. note:: We achieve this via the training missions.

As an open source contributor, I want to visit the OpenHatch site and make a profile listing the projects I've contributed to.

.. :: We are excited about this because we want to have a way to
   semi-automatically publicly thank people who contribute to
   OpenHatch in any of a number of ways. But note also that
   https://contributors.debian.org/ provides a different
   codebase that implements a similar idea, so we could decide this
   isn't something that is a unique value-add the OpenHatch website
   provides the world.

   This requires the ability to edit one's profile, too.


Open Source Project Maintainers
-------------------------------
As an open source project maintainer, I want to visit the OpenHatch
site and be able to configure my project to show up in collection of
bitesize bugs one can browse.

As an open source project maintainer, I want to provide a friendly
face for my project on the OpenHatch site, so that prospective
contributors feel welcomed into the project and reach out to me as
needed to become contributors.
