Documentation Style Guide
=========================

.. note:: OpenHatch's Documentation Style Guide is still a work in
   process. We like Kenneth Reitz's excellent `Guide Style Guide
   <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/notes/styleguide/>`_
   for its concise and consistent style guidelines. We refer you
   to this guide until ours is posted.
