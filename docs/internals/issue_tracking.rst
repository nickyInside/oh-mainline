==================================
Issue tracking using GitHub Issues
==================================

Overview
========

We use `GitHub Issues`_ for tracking issues. The `Managing Projects`_ section of
`GitHub Help`_ provides useful information about filtering, sorting, assigning,
and labeling issues.

.. _`GitHub Issues`: https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/issues
.. _`Managing Projects`: https://help.github.com/categories/100/articles

Issue labels
============

We use `Labels` to categorize an issue's priority, status, and type as well as
other helpful user information. The `Bitesize` label is used to indicate that
the issue is suitable for a new contributor to the project.

Historical note on issue tracking
=================================

Prior to using `GitHub Issues`, we used two other issue trackers. To preserve
historical information, issues that were imported from past trackers can be
identified by the user creator (@imported-from-roundup in the oh-mainline repo
and @bot-sunu in the oh-bugimporters repo).
