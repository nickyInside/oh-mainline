====================================
Welcome to OpenHatch's Documentation
====================================

`OpenHatch <http://openhatch.org/>`_ values open communication. We believe
documentation is an important part of a welcoming community. If you would
like to see some of the projects that we are currently working on, please
visit the OpenHatch website <http://openhatch.org>.

Trying to get your bearings with our documentation?  Take a look at the
:doc:`getting_started/project_overview` or :doc:`community/contact` to ask
questions. We also have a `wiki <https://openhatch.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_
with a lot of informal documentation and other useful things on it.

Confused or dismayed by our documentation?  Please let us know so we can
improve it!  Make an issue on our
`issue tracker <https://github.com/openhatch/oh-mainline/issues>`_
or :doc:`community/contact` via email or IRC to chat with us about it. We
take our documentation seriously and wish it to be helpful to you.
